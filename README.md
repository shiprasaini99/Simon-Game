# Simon-Game

The Simon game is basically an exciting electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you. 
Here, I built a similar game using my own skills. Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels. Play it now!
